<h1>Top 3 movies according to Manas</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies- </h2>
<hr>
<h3>Bahubali:The conclusion</h3>
<p>This is my favourite because it makes me remember of my Dad's words <br>
    He believed in me <br>
    And he conveyed that after the movie by saying I am exactly like Mahendra Bahubali <br>
    Strong, intelligent, leader ,  always angry ðŸ˜‚ etc <br>
</p>
<h3>Iron Man</h3>
<p>Whenever I see him , I see myself in 10 years !</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Made me think a lot about the universe</p>
